# GUADEC 2015 Presentation Templates

This repository contains templates usable for presentations for GUADEC 2015.

## How Can I Create a Presentation?

You can create a presentation using Pandoc or LaTeX. Pandoc is way easier and
recommended as it will be automatically translated into LaTex.

Try it out; open your console, go to the directory where this document lies and
type `make`. This will compile the `presentation.md` into `presentation.pdf` if
you have pandoc installed.

Just look into the md and pdf file to see how you can simply create your
presentation. It's easy! Please try it out!

### Using Latex Directly

You can also use LaTeX directly. Use the `make tex` command to compile the
example tex document into a presentation.
